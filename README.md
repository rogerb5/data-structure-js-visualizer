# Data Structure Visualizer
Data Structures is a course required for many computer science degrees. The concepts may feel abstract to students who may be learning about them for the first time.

This site aims ease the study of data structures by providing an interactive, modern, and intuitive interface. In addition, the structures can be built step by step which ultimately gives the learner more intuition about the structure. The chosen operations for each structure are the most relevant ones, although there may exist custom ones.
