            <h1>A Binary Max Heap</h1>
            <p>A Binary Max Heap has three invariants: </p>

            <p> First, it must be a binary tree which means
                every node must have at most two children. </p>

            <p>
                Next, that every node must be greater than or equal to
                it's children.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, each level is complete meaning it has no gaps, so heaps are filled left to right.
            </p>

            <h1>Basic Max Heap Operations</h1>
            <p>heapify down: swaps node with it's greatest child until the parent is greater than both children
                or we are at a leaf.</p>
            <p>heapify up: swap with the parent until your parent is greater than you or your
                are the overall root</p>

            <p>extract max: removes the max node and replaces the bottom level right most node and heapfies down. </p>
            <p>add: insert a node on the bottom level to ensure no gaps and then you fix the heap invariant by
                heapifying upwards. </p>

            <h1>Applications of Max Heaps in Computer Science</h1>
            <p>A max heap can be used to implement the priority queue in cases where the shortest distances are
                represented as negative values for Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm</p>
            <p>Max heaps are useful in job scheduling scenarios where tasks or jobs have associated priorities or
                deadlines</p>
            <p>Heap memory management in operating systems often involves the use of heaps. In some cases, max heaps can
                be employed for efficient memory allocation.</p>

            <h1>About the Max Heap Visualizer</h1>
            <p>The visualizer uses an zero based array for the heap.</p>
            <p>Duplicate values are not allowed.</p>
            <p>Color Key:<br><br> Yellow signifies swap.</p>
            <p>
                Red means the prior max node that will be deleted, and is heapified down
                to the last heap index.
            </p>
            <p>
                Green showcases the new max node which has heapified upwards.
